My debugging setup is a second Digilent Spartan S3 board.  It handles
-slow clock generation (from around 1Hz on)
-6-wire 4-digit display (4bit nybble and 2-bit select generated by this board)

Since I already had a verilog design, I will just keep it for now.

All connections to the target board are via PortB (right hand side port);
